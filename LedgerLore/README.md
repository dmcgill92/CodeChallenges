# CTF Challenge: Ledger Lore: The Romaine Enigma

## Background

A seemingly ordinary bookstore has been diligently keeping its financial records for over two decades.
The legacy of Julius Romaine, known for his complex and layered thinking, heavily influenced the bookstore's approach to keeping its financial records.
These records, believed by some to hold more than just numbers, contain a coded message waiting to be deciphered by a keen mind.

## Challenge Overview

Your task is to probe into the bookstore's annual financial records. Buried within these records is a concealed key.
This key, cleverly disguised, can decrypt an enigmatic message believed to hold a hidden truth.

## Provided Materials

- A series of annual balance sheets, represented in the `BalanceSheet` class.
- An encrypted string labeled `encryptedFlag`.
- A `Decryptor` tool, which requires a specific key to decrypt the `encryptedFlag`.

## Your Tasks

1. **Scrutinize the Ledgers**: Carefully examine each balance sheet. Look for figures that defy conventional accounting norms.
2. **Interpret the Anomalies**: The irregularities you find may have numerical and symbolic implications. Consider their broader meaning.
3. **Contextual Clues**: The time frame of these records might offer more than a chronological context.
4. **Piece Together the Puzzle**: The anomalies, once interpreted, might need to be arranged or altered to reveal their true significance.
5. **Unlock the Secret**: Employ your derived sequence as a key in the `Decryptor` to reveal the contents of the `encryptedFlag`.

## Hints and Guidelines

- Approach the analysis with a blend of mathematical and lateral thinking.
- Numbers might represent more than their face value; consider how they can be transformed or rearranged.
- Anomalies in the ledgers could be a part of a larger, hidden narrative.
- The key to decryption may require a degree of reorganization to make sense.

## Success Criteria

You will have successfully completed the challenge when you:

- Identify and correctly interpret the hidden code in the balance sheets.
- Transform and possibly rearrange your findings into a coherent decryption key.
- Use the key to successfully decrypt the `encryptedFlag`, unveiling the secret message.
